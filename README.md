## **ABOUT**
I am an Engineering Student. This is a web document of my 4 day Fablab hands-on workshop

## **FABLAB**<br>
<p>Fab lab is a small-scale workshop offering digital fabrication.A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make "almost anything". This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.</p>
<p>The fab lab movement is closely aligned with the DIY, the open source hardware and the free and open source movement, and shares philosophy as well as technology with them.</p>
### ***3D Printer***
<p>3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), refers to processes used to create a three-dimensional object[1] in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object. Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. STL is one of the most common file types that 3D printers can read.3D printing or AM builds a three-dimensional object from computer-aided design (CAD) model or AMF file by successively adding material layer by layer.<br>

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/salwathasveen/salwathasveen.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/salwathasveen/salwathasveen.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
